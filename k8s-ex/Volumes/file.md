#### First Commit - Data is saved in container, and if that container inside the pod is deleted, all the data is removed. We created a deployment with 1 pod, inside of that pod was just 1 mongodb container. We created a service to expose that pod in a port. We used localhost:32000 to connect with this pod using mongo compass. In mongo compass we created a db and a record inside it, that means that inside the pod was this db and record. Then we went inside the pod using "exec -it ... -- /bin/bash" and killed mongodb process, so we destroyed that container. We went to the mongo compass and saw that the db and the record was deleted too.

### Solution of that above-> store the data in pod level, use emptyDir. Data is stored as the pod is running. Even if the container is restarted, the data is stored in the pod. If multiple containers, we can mount those containers to the same volume, because volume is created in pod level, and we use it to the container.  Now if we create that deployment, and the service and go to mongo compass using the localhost:expose_port, create a db and a record, then go inside the pod and kill the container, then we can go to mongo compass and see that the db and record is not deleted. This is all beacuse we created a volume in pod level that container can use.
