#### First Commit - Data is saved in container, and if that container inside the pod is deleted, all the data is removed. We created a deployment with 1 pod, inside of that pod was just 1 mongodb container. We created a service to expose that pod in a port. We used localhost:32000 to connect with this pod using mongo compass. In mongo compass we created a db and a record inside it, that means that inside the pod was this db and record. Then we went inside the pod using "exec -it ... -- /bin/bash" and killed mongodb process, so we destroyed that container. We went to the mongo compass and saw that the db and the record was deleted too.
